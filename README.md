# net

**net** is a simplified relationial database visualizer. It has been inspired by my need to visualize how particular individuals relate to other individuals. The general concept builds on three necessities:

1. Nodes: an entity. Nodes can relate to other nodes.
2. Node Relations: the specific relationship between nodes.
3. Nets: a complete, interconnected network of nodes

**Is this thing on?** Nope. This is completely an idea right now. I haven't written a lick of nothing.
